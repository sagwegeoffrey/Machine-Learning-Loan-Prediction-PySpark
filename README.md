# Machine-Learning-Loan-Prediction-PySpark
This repository contains mini project for loan approval using machine learning and pyspark

Prediction of Modernized Loan Approval model based on Machine Learning and Distributed PySpark Ecosystem.
The project demonstrates the use of PySpark and Machine Learning to predict loan approvals. The application approved or not approved depends upon 
the historical data of the candidate.Everyday lots of people applying for the loan in the banking sector but banks would have limited funds. 
In this case, the right prediction would be very beneficial using some class-function algorithm. An example of the Decision Trees, 
Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, etc., Bankâ€™s profit and loss depend on the amount of the loans that is whether the 
client or customer is paying back the loan. Recovery of loans is the most important for the banking sector.The improvement process plays
an important role in the banking sector. The historical data of candidates was used to build a machine learning model using different classification 
algorithms. The main objective is to predict whether a new applicant granted the loan or not using machine learning model trained on the historical dataset.

The project involve the following steps:
1.	Data Collection: Collecting data related to loan approvals, including features such as income, credit score, loan amount, and loan status.
2.	Data Preparation: Preprocessing and cleaning up the data to ensure it is ready for use in Machine Learning algorithms.
3.	Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering relevant features to improve the accuracy of the model.
4.	Model Training: Using PySpark to train a Machine Learning model on the prepared data.
5.	Model Evaluation: Testing the trained model on a validation set to evaluate its accuracy and adjust the parameters if necessary.
6.	Loan Prediction: Using the trained model to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on input features.
The project will require knowledge of PySpark, Machine Learning, and Python programming. The end result will be a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict loan approvals based on various features. This can be used by financial institutions or individuals to make more informed decisions regarding loans. The project can be extended by exploring different Machine Learning algorithms and improving the accuracy of the model.

Dataset
The bank/company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These 
details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process is to
identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. This is a standard supervised
classification task. A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. Below is the dataset attributes with description.
